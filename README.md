# super-wallet

## üí° Description

SupperWallet is simple API that allows users to interact with a virtual `Wallet`. It is build according to the layered architecture style, where we are layers for the controllers, services and repositories. <br>

Each `User` can have multiple wallets as his possession. 

Each `Wallet` can have a `name`, `balance`, `currencyCode` (ISO 4217) and `status`. 
The user can `deposit()`/`withdraw()` money to/from their wallets. These are some of the operations the user can make with a wallet:

- `createWallet()`
  - A user can't have two wallets with the same name, but two wallets with the same name can exist in the database.
  - Each wallet can be created with a given currency. At the moment the database support the currencies of the 6
    strongest economies.
- `updateWallet()` 
  - A user can only update his wallet's information.
  - A user is able to change the `status` on their wallet to either *Active* of *Frozen*. A wallet with status set to *Frozen* can't
  make deposits and withdrawals.
  - The `currencyCode` of the wallet can be change only if the wallet's balance is equal to 0.
- `getWalletBalance()`
  - A user can only get the balance of their own wallets.
- `getWalletById()` - Gets the whole information about the wallet.
- `depositToWallet()`
  - Takes money from the user's `PocketMoney` and transfers them to his wallet of choice.
- `withdrawFromWallet()`
  - Take money from the user's wallet and transfers them to their `PocketMoney` of choice.


The `PocketMoney` object represents money you have in your pocket. For instance User1 may have 100 BGN and 50 EUR for instance. 
This is the source the user use for making deposits to the wallet and the destination where he withdraws money from the wallet.
